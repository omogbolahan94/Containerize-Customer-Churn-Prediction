This file is about how to using pipenv as a package manager

# Install pipenv from pip
>>> pip install pipenv

# Install the required packages needed by the project using pipenv (you can install any dependencies any time)
# this will also create a virtual environment for us with Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files
>>> pipenv install numpy scikit-learn==0.24.2 flask

# activate the pipenv environment variable
>>> pipenv shell

# Who ever clones this project can use the exact dependencies on their local machine my just using the command:
>>> pipenv install

# to get the location of current pipenv virtual environment
>>> pipenv --venv

################ ASSUMMING WE ARE USING VENV ####################
# We can create a requirement.txt file. This file will contain all dependencies in the venv virtual environment
and their versions on a separate line

# the command to create this file is:
# >>> pip freeze > requirement.text
